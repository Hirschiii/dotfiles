# Nice Script I wrote

## [Toggle light and dark mode](./.local/bin/colortheme)

This helps when I work outside in the sun or in very light room in general. It uses the ability by alacritty to live changes. When I press a key, I get the light (or dark) mode immediately.
It also toggle my color scheme in NeoVim, but there I am currently working on a live Change. Thought about starting neovim as a Sever and doing this by remote reload config.
